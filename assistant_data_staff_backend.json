Here are the profiles for the two categories:\n\n**Unqualified Candidate Profile:**\n- Candidates lacking in significant backend software development experience.\n- Insufficient familiarity with modern backend programming languages like Java, Python, and C#.\n- Limited or no experience with cloud services, microservices, distributed systems, or web application development.\n- A lack of advanced education in computer science or related fields. Some may only possess certificates from non-academic institutions.\n- Inexperienced with software development best practices, tools, and life cycle methodologies like Agile.\n\n**Over-Qualified Candidate Profile:**\n- Extensive experience in the tech industry, often surpassing 10 years, indicative of being at a level higher than that of a staff engineer, such as senior staff engineer or tech lead.\n- Command over a wide range of programming languages, technical stacks, and tools including TypeScript, JavaScript, Golang, Java, Python, Angular, React, Express, and advanced databases.\n- Experience in project management, leading teams, and acting as a chief architect in previous roles.\n- History of involvement in GenAI projects, suggesting a candidate seeking roles that involve next-generation AI and software capabilities.\n- Proficiency in development tools and web security measures that are often seen in the resumes of candidates who have been in senior leadership or specialized roles for many years.\n\nWith these profiles, you can have a reference for assessing incoming candidates and determining if they're ideal, unqualified, or over-qualified for the role of Staff Backend Software Engineer."}
