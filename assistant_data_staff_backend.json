Educational background in technical fields such as Electrical Engineering, Computer Science from prestigious universities (e.g., University of California, Berkeley in a qualified candidate's resume\u301013\u2020source\u3011).\n\n2. Extensive experience in leading technical teams and projects. This includes managing teams of engineers and working closely with other departments like risk and finance (as seen in the qualified candidate's section)\u301013\u2020source\u3011.\n\n3. Proven track record of successful implementation of technically challenging projects, such as developing payment compliance systems, international financial institutions integrations, ads recommendation algorithms, and knowledge graphs\u301013\u2020source\u3011\u301014\u2020source\u3011.\n\n4. Demonstrated ability to operate effectively as both an individual contributor and a team leader, sponsoring the growth of junior engineers and delivering products end-to-end\u301014\u2020source\u3011.\n\n5. Experience with AI and building large-scale systems, for instance, ledger, payments, and billing systems, as well as development in highly competitive companies (e.g., Uber)\u301015\u2020source\u3011.\n\nConversely, candidates who do not meet the requirements tend to have a background more aligned with game development and entertainment multimedia, with a focus on skills such as Unity and Unreal Engine development, 3D Art, and Animation\u301019\u2020source\u3011. Though these skills are technical and relevant in their domain, they do not align with backend software engineering roles which typically require experience with backend systems, scalability, security, data processing, API development, and other non-frontend intensive skills.\n\nTo summarize, the requirements for the Staff Backend Software Engineer position likely include:\n\n- A degree in a technical field from a reputable institution.\n- Technical leadership experience and the ability to work in cross-functional teams.\n- Experience with backend systems, scalability, and performance optimization.\n- Successfully leading and delivering complex technical projects.\n- Experience in professional environments requiring high levels of technical proficiency.\n\nThese requirements are deduced from analyzing the backgrounds of both qualified and unqualified candidates as presented in their resumes."}
