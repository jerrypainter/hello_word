However, using the quotes already extracted, I can make some assessments and provide you with some evaluations for the candidates highlighted. For a complete and thorough analysis of all candidates and the summary of the key qualifications, I would need additional information from the files. Let me provide ratings based on the qualifications we can extract.\n\nKey qualifications appear to include:\n- Strong educational background in Computer Science or related field.\n- Extensive experience in Backend Engineering or relevant technical roles, with progressive responsibility.\n- Proven leadership capabilities, such as leading teams or critical projects.\n- Experience with large-scale systems, dealing with high-volume transactions or data.\n- Ability to work with cross-functional teams and provide mentorship.\n\nLet's evaluate the candidates based on the extracted excerpts:\n\n1. [Rippling, Pinterest, Shiv Toolsidass, Rong Yang, Xintian Li, Aditya Muttur, Emily To, Zihao Wang (assessed together)][13]\n\nBased on the quotes provided, all of these candidates seem to illustrate extensive experience in high-responsibility technical roles, with involvement in scalable systems and cross-functional coordination. It is unfortunate that I cannot provide detailed individual assessment ratings without more context.\n\nGiven the qualifications and experience in these roles, it seems likely that they would score highly, possibly in the 7-10 range on the qualifications outlined.\n\nWithout access to specific details, it would be difficult to provide an accurate minimum score for qualification. However, based on industry standards for similar roles, a typical cutoff might be around 7, assuming each qualification is rated equally and candidates must show strength across all areas to be considered qualified.\n\nFor the complete evaluation of qualifications and ratings for each candidate, we would need full access to all information in the uploaded files. If you require a detailed evaluation, I would advise trying an alternative method to access and analyze the content of the files."}
