Examples of universities attended by ideal candidates include:\n- Carnegie Mellon University\u30106\u2020source\u3011\u301011\u2020source\u3011.\n- University of Waterloo\u30107\u2020source\u3011.\n\n**Professional Experience:**\nThe professional experience of ideal candidates often involves:\n- Experience working in reputable companies or known startups with significant responsibilities and achievements.\n- A track record of successful project completion and progression into roles with increased accountability.\n- Specific roles and responsibilities that demonstrate technical leadership, strategic thinking, and a commitment to delivering high-quality software solutions.\n\n**Technical Skills:**\nIdeal candidates possess a broad range of technical skills necessary for backend development, including:\n- Proficiency in programming languages such as Java, C++, Python, and Ruby\u30109\u2020source\u3011\u301012\u2020source\u3011.\n- A deep understanding of software architecture and design principles.\n- Experience with cloud services, databases, and server technologies.\n- Familiarity with agile development methodologies and DevOps practices.\n\nNote: Due to the limitations of the myfiles_browser tool and formatting irregularities in the resumes, extracting granular details like exact years of experience, notable projects, and other specific qualifications was challenging. Therefore, the profile above is based on the general trends observed in the education backgrounds and skills mentioned across the resumes. For a more detailed profile, it would be necessary to analyze each resume individually and list specific examples of relevant experience.\n\nNext, I will analyze the second file to separate the resumes into unqualified and over-qualified candidates, and then I will build profiles based on these categories. Let's proceed with opening the other file."}
