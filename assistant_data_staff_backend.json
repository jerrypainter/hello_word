As a result, I'm unable to provide a numeric rating for the resumes of candidates who are not qualified for the position of Staff Backend Software Engineer.\n\nTo give a general sense of what might lead to a lower qualification score:\n\n- Lack of or less experience in leadership or managing a technical team.\n- Being less involved in designing, developing, and launching significant systems or platform components.\n- Having experience that is not aligned with backend software engineering or the tech stack relevant to the role.\n- Limited usage of modern programming languages and technologies as well as less advanced systems design expertise.\n- Limited exposure to working cross-functionally with diverse teams (product, risk, legal, finance, operations, etc.).\n\nGiven the summarized requirements from the qualified resumes, a candidate might be considered qualified for the Staff Backend Software Engineer position if they would likely score a 7 or higher out of 10 based on these criteria, corresponding to a strong alignment with the identified requirements. However, without reviewing the actual content of the resumes and being able to provide specific scores, this is a theoretical guideline.\n\nI genuinely regret the inconvenience caused by these technical issues. If you would like to proceed in another manner or have any additional requests, please let me know."}
